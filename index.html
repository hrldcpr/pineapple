			<h2>My background.</h2>
      <p>I teach yoga and qi gong because I care about people. I care about bodies. I believe caring for ourselves and for each other is where the mundane and sacred meet.<br />
<br />
         I started practicing yoga in 2012 shortly after I moved to New York. As I passed through the worlds of academia, children’s books, education, and nonprofits, my practice rooted and oriented me. When my grandmother got sick in 2017, I quit everything else and committed myself to what mattered the most to me — my family, my practice, and my community.<br />
<br />
As I continued to care for my dying grandmother, I increasingly centered my life on the exploration of embodied consciousness. I started teaching yoga and mindfulness in schools. I began a committed qi gong practice. I completed my yoga teacher training. I expanded my teaching to include adults as well as children.<br />
<br />
It has been an honor to work sharing the practices that have transformed my life. I can’t promise they will be transformative for you, but I hope you will explore their potential with me.<br />
