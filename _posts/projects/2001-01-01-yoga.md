<p>The physical practice of yoga is a powerful tool for engaging and orienting your whole self â€” body, mind, and spirit. My classes are always beginner-friendly, focusing on intelligent movement and energetic awareness. My goal is for you to leave class refreshed and connected. I am eternally grateful to Magi Pierce and my community at Kula Yoga Project for their teachings and support.</p>
