<p>As children grow into themselves, yoga and mindfulness practices promote self-awareness and confidence. In my classes, children have fun with yoga-based movement, games, stories, and songs. They learn to be present in their bodies and with their breath, thoughts, and feelings. My goal is for students to use the practices and concepts we learn together in their everyday lives.
