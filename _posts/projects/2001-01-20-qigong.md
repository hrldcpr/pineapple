<span class="h2">My Approach.</span>
<p>Qi gong is an ancient practice of energy cultivation. Related to tai ji, it is rooted in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts. Classes include meditation, standing movement, and postures. These meditative physical practices are designed to teach you to feel how energy moves through your body. Join me in learning how to embody yourself more fully, right here and now, between the sky and the earth.</p>
